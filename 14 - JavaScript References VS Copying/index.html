    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age,age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age,age2);
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // team is a reference to original array
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; // will update both Arrays

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!


    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); //returns entire array, makes a copy
    const team3 [].concat(players);

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; //takes every entire out of iterable, and put it into the containing array
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Callie Brooks',
      age: 80
    };
    // and think we make a copy:
    // can't do below:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99; //updates person as well, just a reference to original

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const capt2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99 });
    //Object.assign({empty obj}, obj want to copy, {any values that need to be updated or added})

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const capt3 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    //example:
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    // the above works for the first level
    // any changes made to the social obj will affect both dev and wes, only a reference
    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    // will change twitter in both wes and dev
    console.log(wes, dev);
    // will need a clode deep function if need to copy deeper than one level

    // cheat
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
